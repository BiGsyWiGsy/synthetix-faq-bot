      "value": "HAV tokens had a name change to SNX, so you don’t have to convert them. However, your wallet may not have updated the name, because not every cryptocurrency wallet enables all ERC-20 tokens to be viewable by default.\nFirst check the token balance of your address on [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) to see if you actually have SNX. If they are showing in etherscan but not in your wallet, then you’ll know it’s just that your wallet provider/viewer has not updated yet. If so, look for your wallet provider's help documents to find out how to add custom tokens. "
