      "value": "We've implemented a minimum deposit to prevent bad actors filling the queue with tiny amounts (e.g. .0000005) of sUSD, which could cause anyone buying sUSD on Synthetix.Exchange to pay a large amount of gas as they attempted to gather all the tiny entries of sUSD. \n \nFor amounts lower than $50, sell it on an exchange where sUSD is listed, Uniswap, or use it at Synthetix.Exchange to trade for other synthetic assets such as sBTC or Gold."
