      "value": "If your C-Ratio is below the Target Collateralization Ratio (currently set at 800% Collateral at this of this article), you will be blocked from claiming rewards and you will need to increase your C-Ratio to claim.You can increase your C-Ratio in two ways: 1) Burning sUSD, or 2) Buying more SNX and mint more sUSD. If your C-Ratio is below the Target Collateralization Ratio, you will be blocked and unable to claim your fee rewards. If your C-Ratio is above the Target Collateralization Ratio, Mintr will display your status as 'Good' and you can then: 1) Do nothing. Continue to receive fees against your existing minted sUSD. 2) Mint more sUSD. To receive a greater proposition of fees in the next fee period. 3) If you choose to mint more sUSD, you may want to leave a buffer of sUSD to accommodate market fluctuation of the SNX price. Your Collateralization Ratio must be above the Target Collateralization Ratio to be able to claim your fee rewards."
