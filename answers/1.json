      "value": "When you 'claim' SNX rewards in the staking app you are assigned your portion of SNX in an escrow record in the [RewardEscrow Contract ](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb671F2210B1F6621A2607EA63E6B2DC3e2464d1F). Your rewards will not show in your wallet address, but they are assigned to your wallet address to be vested in 12 months from their claim date. You will now be able to mint from those escrowed SNX as they can still be used for collateral, effectively allowing a compound effect on SNX rewards for ongoing stakers.",
