      "value": "One limitation of the Synthetix system is that the total value of all synths is capped by the SNX token itself. To further increase  the amount of synths in the system, synth can be minted against ETH Collateral. Traders can obtain a sETH loan for 125% ETH collateral and pay a 5% interest fee. The current sETH loan against ETH collateral is currently experimental will last only last three months and traders must repay their loans by the closing of the period.\n\nYou can take out an ETH Collateral loan here."

      "title": "Community Discussion",
      "value": "There was a lengthy [discussion](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/issues/232) of the pros and cons on the Synthetix Github issues page.\n\nCrucially, ETH collateral stakers will not be eligible for staking rewards. Fees will be directed into the SNX stakers rewards pool.\n\nAfter the experimental Skinny ETH Collateral period ends in May 2020, the initiative will be revisited and reformed based on trader and community feedback, as well as an analysis of the mechanics of the system."
