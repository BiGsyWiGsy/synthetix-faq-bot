      "value": "The ETH Wrappr is a contract that accepts deposits in ETH or WETH and in return mints sETH in the userâ€™s wallet. It also allows for the reverse, i.e. sETH -> ETH or WETH.\n\nWhy have this? It allows ETH holders to easily enter and exit Kwenta with the least amount of friction possible.\n\nAnother benefit is to act as a peg balancing layer that allows arbers to enter and exit with the least friction possible. For more detailed information on this and other aspects of the contract, see: \n\n[SIP 112: ETH Wrappr](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-112)"
