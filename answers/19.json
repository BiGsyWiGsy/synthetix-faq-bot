If you experience someone that appears to be a Synthetix team member offering you SNX, in Telegram or Discord, know that they are impostors trying to scam you.. To help protect the community please report the scammers on telegram @NoToScam refer to this [link](https://telegram.org/faq) or on [Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)."
