      "value": "To unlock your locked SNX, you need to 'burn' the sUSD you debt owed. Burning will unlock your escrowed SNX first then it will start unlocking your SNX in your wallet to transfer.  \n\nIf you had $1000 worth of SNX you would have been able to mint ~133 sUSD (at the 750% Collateralization Ratio). This would lock up all of your SNX, thus making it non-transferrable. You cant mint money then sell your collateral used to supply it. The minted amount must be burned. \n\nSo you now need to burn that 133 sUSD you minted (give or take any fluctuations in your debt) to unlock your SNX so you can transfer it. Mintr will tell you how much sUSD you need to burn to unlock your SNX."

      "value": "If you have an sUSD debt but you have no sUSD in your wallet then you must have done one of the following:\n\n1. Transferred it to another wallet\n 2. Transferred it to an exchange and sold it\n3. Sent it to the Depot to be purchased via Synthetix.Exchange\n 4. Exchanged it into another Synth on Synthetix.Exchange\n 5. Deposited it to a liquidity pool such as Curve, to earn yields. \n\nTo unlock your SNX, you must acquire the amount of sUSD under Debt in Mintr. If you transferred it to another wallet or an exchange, you will need to transfer it back into the wallet that contains your locked SNX. And if you sold the sUSD, you must buy it back. If you deposited sUSD to a liquidity pool, you must unlock/vest it from there and withdraw it back to your wallet. \n\nOnce you've paid back your sUSD debt, your SNX will be unlocked and able to be transferred.
