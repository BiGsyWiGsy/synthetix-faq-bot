Itâ€™s a dApp built on the Synthetix protocol.\n\nIt was originally known as Synthetix Exchange, and was renamed to Kwenta, after community discussion and voting.  \n\n[Kwenta is now live](https://blog.kwenta.io/kwenta-is-now-live/).\n\nIf you are interested in the process that led to the change, you can read this part of the original discussion by team member Garth Travers: [Renaming synthetix.exchange to Kwenta](https://research.synthetix.io/t/renaming-synthetix-exchange-discussion-of-kwenta/124/28)"
