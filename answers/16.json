      "value": "If you've just staked your SNX to mint sUSD, there are a variety of things you can do with it. \n\nFirstly, there is Synthetix.Exchange, which is a trading platform allowing you to trade your sUSD for any of our synthetic assets (Synths). It currently supports a variety of forex currencies (e.g. sEUR), cryptocurrencies (e.g. sBTC), and assets (e.g. gold/ounce as sXAU). The best thing is, it doesn't require a counterparty, so there's no waiting around for your trade to get filled. So for example, if you'd like exposure to Bitcoin without leaving Ethereum, you can trade your sUSD for sBTC on Synthetix.Exchange. Fees on each trade depends on the synth flavor you are trading into, these fees are displayed before confirming a trade on synthetix.exchange. The fees are distributed to SNX holders as reward for staking the system."
